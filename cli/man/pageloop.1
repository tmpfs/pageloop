.h1 "CONFIGURATION"
.P
Use a YAML configuration file to control the service behaviour. The configuration file should be writable so that new applications created using the user interface can be persisted.
.nl
.P
The \fBaddr\fR configuration field sets the server bind address, it may be a port in the form :8080 or fully qualified host or IP address such as 0.0.0.0:8080.
.nl
.P
When applications are mounted they are published to a directory which is configured using the \fBpublish\fR field, the directory must be writable. If no publish directory is configured the default location is a \fBpublic\fR directory relative to the current working directory.
.nl
.P
Define a \fBmountpoints\fR list in the configuration file to specify applications to load when the server starts. Each entry can contain the fields:
.nl
.TP
\fBurl\fR Public URL mountpoint
.nl
.TP
\fBpath\fR Path to the source files
.nl
.TP
\fBdescription\fR A short description of the application
.nl
.P
Note that applications mounted from a user configuration file are appended to the list of system mountpoints, you cannot control system applications.
.nl
.h1 "PUBLISH"
.P
When applications are published they are written to the publish directory with a namespace which is the container name and application name. Such that system/editor is the editor application in the system container.
.nl
.P
Container and application names must be unique. For applications the name is derived from the basename of the path and it is an error if two applications in the same container have the same name.
