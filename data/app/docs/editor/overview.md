When editing an application you are presented with the main navigation 
at the top and three columns; the sidebar, editor and preview.

<div class="tip">Use the â—© link to maximize a column.</div>

## Sidebar

The sidebar contains a list of pages, files and media. The files 
list shows all the files in the application whilst the pages list 
contains just the files that will be published as HTML pages. Use the 
media list to quickly access multimedia files such as images, audio 
and video.

Select a file to open it in the editor; if the file is a page the 
published version of the file is loaded in the preview area.

## Editor

The editor view in the centre is where you can make changes to 
individual files. You can visually edit a page or use the code view to 
edit the source code directly.

The file tab shows meta information and allows you to rename and 
delete files.

Pages also have a data view that provides an interface for editing 
the meta data associated with a document. This is where you can set 
the language, title, description and any other data you need.

## Preview

The preview area shows the published version of a page. It only 
changes when you select a page and is refreshed when you save a file 
so you can easily switch between stylesheets, scripts and markup and 
quickly preview your changes.
